        <p class="p-base">What separates the Oatmeal Stout from other Stouts is a simple addition of oats and sweetness. Generally, oats will make up only around 5 percent of the total grain to avoid problems in the brewing process due to its thick consistency when it is hydrated. Oatmeal Stouts also tend to be sweeter than the other Stouts but not due to the oats, which tend to leave more of an astringent grainy note when too much is added. The sweetness comes from the amount of malt used and the use of a yeast strain that doesn't consume too much of the sugars. These combinations leave a great balance between the roasted character and sweetness, while the oats add to the silky smoothness and cause the body to be fuller than normal. Most stand around 5 percent alcohol by volume; however, there are some that are upward of 7 percent and are quite robust.
        Incredibly smooth and creamy, nearly full-bodied and a bit viscous. More body than the appearance leads you to believe. The maltiness comes across first, with a distinct toasty character, followed by bread crusts and a thin honey-like sweetness. Slightly sticky and resiny berry-like flavors smooth out the malty sweetness, with a slight tart edge that's gone in a flash, leaving an interesting gin-like bite. Finishes with a touch of residual maltiness and a flavored-iced-tea-like linger, with a slowly drying palate.</p>
